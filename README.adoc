Swift license plate recognition deep learning model with a cross-platform front-end to obtain info. pertaining to the vehicle in real-time. This project is currently an MVP, with the vision to become a one-stop car app.

== About The Project

Zesta is a cross-platform mobile application that allows you to scan a vehicle's license plate and get information about it in real-time. The app uses your phone's camera to capture an image of the license plate, sends it to a server for processing, and displays the results.

The backend is powered by a Node.js server that communicates with a Python script. The Python script uses a deep learning model to recognize the license plate from the image.

== Usage

. Open the app on your device.
. Point your camera at a license plate and tap the "Click!!" button.
. Tap the "Send to server for evaluation!!" button.
. Henceforth, obtain license plate number and other relevant vehicle information.

== Under Development

This project is currently an MVP. The vision is to develop it into a multi-feature, one-stop car app. Future features could include:

* *Integration with Indian RTO's Parivahan Database:* To fetch official vehicle and owner data.
* *Challan/Fine Tracking:* Check for any outstanding traffic fines.
* *Insurance and PUC Status:* Verify the validity of the vehicle's insurance and Pollution Under Control (PUC) certificate.
* *Registered Owner Information:* Display details of the registered owner.
* *Digital Garage:* A feature to manage your own vehicles, track repairs, and set reminders for insurance renewals, etc.
* *All-in-One:* Access all these features simply by taking a picture of a license plate.
